VICTORY POINTS
==============
For deciding which unit wins in a clash, there are victory points.
Each unit starts with 3 VP.
More VP can be added or removed.

These are the conditions:
Tired: -1 point. Happens when a unit fights 3 times in a row.
Starved: -1 point. Happens when a unit is not connected to a supply line.
Active: +1 point. Happens when a unit is not fighting for 3 turns.
Supported: +1 point. Happens when a unit is near an unit of another type.

There are different types of units:
Marines - Jungle Leaves
Tanks - Stone Brick
Airplanes - Iron Block
Submarines - Prismarine Block
Ships - Spruce Planks

Tanks > Marines
Airplanes > Tanks
Ships > Airplanes
Subs > Ships
Marines > Subs
">" Indicates that the unit to the left of the symbol gains more VP advantage.

Supply Lines
------------
Supply lines - Flower Pots 
Supply lines are connected from ships to the sea to soldiers on land.
If a land unit does not have any, they get the "Starved" condition.

Cities
---------
Troops defending the capital have a +2 VP condition.
Troops defending provincial capitals gain a +1 VP condition.

MILITARY FUNDING
=============
A nation can make each unit stronger by 1 VP or one specific type of unit stronger by 2 VP.
This funding comes from spending 'richness' from trade routes by the rules of Economic Victory.

Economic Victory
---------------
'Richness' is defined by the number of trade routes and factories. 
Although the routes do remain if you use them, they will not be counted in the Economic Victory path.
The affected routes may be reinstated given enough time or special measures are used.


DIFFERENTIATION AND USATION
===========================
To indicate country of troop origin, there will be banners suited for each country.
Each unit can move by 3 each turn, although this is reduced to one when moving through rivers and/or mountains.
However, if you are a ship/sub/airplane, you can move through those areas in the 3 move rule. This depends on type of unit, of course.

There will be a sign on each block stating their VP, and whole clusters can merge their VP together (Applies latterally, not vertically)
In a cluster case, the VP of the winner is subtracted from the VP of the loser and will be rounded down to the nearest multiple of 3. 
For each of these, 1 unit at the loser's side choosing will be removed from the winning side while all of the units from the losers side will be removed.
