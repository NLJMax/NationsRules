VICTORY POINTS
===================
This game has victory points („VP“) for deciding which unit wins in a fight. Each unit starts with 3 VP. More VP can be added or removed, as can be seen below.

COMBAT RULES
===================
Spawning -
A military base allows you to build 2 ground regiments („units“).
A naval base allows you to build 2 naval flotillas („units“).

Unit Types -
A regiment or flotilla („unit“) is represented by the following:
Infantry - Leaves
Armored - Stone Brick
Airplanes - Iron Block
Artillery - Dispenser
Submarines - Prismarine Block
Surface Navy - Spruce Planks
Carrier Navy - Birch Planks

Placement -
Placing troops (starting and reinforcements) must be on friendly terrain and on your side of a body of water. Bodies of water are split in two unless they are too small. During sea invasions, the surrounding sea is considered friendly.
Carriers are able to spawn 1 plane Unit at every even turn (excluding 0).

Marking -
You must use a banner of your color (or the closest approximation of it) to mark your units. The banner must be placed in a cardinal direction and it determines the direction the troop is facing.

Divisions -
Divisions („Clusters“) are a group of friendly units. Their size can range from a minimum of 2 units to a maximum of all of your units. Diagonal units are not in a division unless another unit connects them.

Movement -
During a sea invasion, artillery is able to move 2 blocks, armor and infantry can move 3, and planes/subs/naval are always 4.
After landfall, artillery can move 3 blocks (+1 when in a 2 block range of allied infantry), while armor, infantry and planes can move 4 blocks. Sea units cannot go on land.
Diagonal movement is allowed.

Attacking -
To attack, you must be adjacent to any enemy unit in a LOS („line of sight“). Artillery ignores LOS and has a range of two blocks.

Attacking Affinities -
Units can have advantages to other units gaining +1 VP:
Infantry beats Artillery.
Armor beat Infantry.
Artillery beat Armor.
Airplanes beat Submarines.
Naval beat Airplanes.
Submarines beat Navy.

Attacking Bonuses -
Attacks from the front/diagonally infront are frontal attacks. No VP gain.
Attacks from the side are flank attacks and grant the attacker +1 VP.
Attacks from behind/diagonally behind are rear attacks, which grants the attacker +2 VP.
Troops defending a naval or military base have a +2 VP advantage.
Troops defending the national capital have a +2 VP advantage.
Troops defending cities and regional capitals have a +1 VP advantage.
Establishing air supremacy (having more then twice the plane units your enemy has) grants a +1 VP advantage.

Formula -
To calculate losses, you calculate X-Y with X being the enemy and Y being allied units. Floor to the nearest multiple of 5 and divide the result by 5. Positive values are your losses, negative values are enemy losses.
​Equivalent py script:
import math

losses = abs(math.floor((enemy - allied)/5)
if losses > 0:
    print(f"The Enemy lost {losses} units.")
elif losses < 0:
    print(f"The Allies lost {losses} units.")
else:
    print("No losses")

NUCLEAR WEAPONS
===================
Nuclear weapons need to be explicitly researched and are split into the following categories:
Tactical - Destroys everything in a 3x3 block area from the epicentre.
Strategical - Destroys everything in a 5x5 block area from the epicentre.
Deterent - Destroys everything in a 7x7 block area from the epicentre.

Detonating a nuclear device requires any of the three following criteria to be met:
There must be an artillery unit (artillery range used, no LOS).
There must be a plane unit (2 block range used, LOS).
There must be finished research on missile technology (infinite range, no LOS).
